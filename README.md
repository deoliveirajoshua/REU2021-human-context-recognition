# REU2021-human-context-recognition

This project researches the efficacy of controllable generative models (GANs) for human context recognition via mobile sensor data. Our goal is to develop novel generative architectures in order to predict a <i>target subject</i>'s missing sensor data for an activity based on patterns in data from other subjects that performed the activity along with the <i>target subject</i>'s unique "style". In addition, we look to compare the characterisitics of real-world and controlled mobile sensor datasets to learn more about the feasiblility of data recorded in controlled environments for real-world applications.
